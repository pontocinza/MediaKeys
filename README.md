Assigns Media functions to NumPad Keys

I love simple keyboards like the Logitech K120 and I wrote this tiny script to make up for the lack of multimedia keys for music listening. This simple script converted my inexpensive keyboard into a multimedia keyboard, and because it could also be useful for other people, I decided to share it. Even my wife, who uses a Logitech MK345, loved the program, as she can now trigger any multimedia function using just one key.

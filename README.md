# MediaKeys
Assigns Media functions to NumPad Keys

I love simple keyboards like the Logitech K120 and I wrote this little script to make up for the lack of multimedia keys for listening to music. Because this simple script allows the transformation of a inexpensive keyboard into a multimedia keyboard, it may be useful for other people, and so I decided to share it. Even my wife, who uses a Logitech MK345, loved the program, as she can now trigger any multimedia function using just one key.

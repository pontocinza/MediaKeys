  MediaKeys 1.0 [2022.10.18]

  MediaKeys is a program for Windows, a very simple script that 
  assigns media functions to seven keys of the NumPad (numeric 
  keypad). Another four keys were remapped to run Windows Explorer 
  (My Computer), Control Panel, Calculator and Notepad. The visual
  map of the keys is available in the image file "MediaKeys.png".
  
  Because all the functions removed from the NumPad are redundant, 
  no actual functionality is lost. The "NumLock" key will keep 
  switching between the use of functions and the use of numbers 
  for math operations. Finally, the execution of MediaKeys can be 
  paused or stopped via the program's icon in the System Tray.
  
  HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM AUTOMATICALLY EVERY WINDOWS STARTUP
  
  1. Copy the file "MediaKeys.exe" to a folder of your choice;
  2. Create, in this folder, a shortcut to the program;
  3. Copy this shortcut to the "Startup" folder.
  
  To quickly access the "Startup" folder, type "shell:startup"
  (without the quotes) in the Windows Explorer address bar.

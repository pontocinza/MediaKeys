  MediaKeys 2.0.0 [2022.10.23]
  ____________________________
  ____________________________
  
  MediaKeys is a very simple program for Windows x64 that assigns 
  media functions to seven keys of the NumPad (numeric keypad).
  
  Another eight keys or combination of keys were remapped to run the
  "Alt+Tab" shortcut plus a few Windows Applications. As a rule, 
  applications that run only one instance were remapped to a single 
  key, and applications that can run innumerable simultaneous instances 
  were remapped to a combination of keys. The only exception to this 
  general rule is the Resource Monitor, which runs a single instance 
  but is triggered with a combination of keys.
  
  The map of the keys can be seen in the file "MediaKeys.png".
  
  Because all the functions in the NumPad are redundant, no actual 
  functionality is lost while using MediaKeys. The "NumLock" key will 
  keep switching between the use of functions and the use of numbers 
  for math operations and, if needed, the execution of MediaKeys can 
  be paused or stopped via the program's icon in the System Tray.
  
  ALTERNATIVE VERSION
  
  A simpler version of this program, which contains only the Media 
  Keys and the Alt+Tab functionality, can be found here:

  INSTALLING THE PROGRAM
  
  The installer (MediaKeys-2.0.0-SETUP.exe) will create a directory
  in the Programs' folder and place a shortcut in the user's "Startup" 
  folder. This way, the program will run automatically whenever 
  Windows starts.
  
  HOW TO UNINSTALL THE PROGRAM
  
  To uninstall MediaKeys, follow these steps:
  
  1. Delete the folder "C:\Program Files\MediaKeys\".
  2. Browse the "Startup" folder by typing "shell:startup" (without 
     the quotes) in the File Explorer address bar and delete the 
     shortcut "MediaKeys".
  
  CHANGELOG
  
  2.0  + Added AutoHotkey recommended entries.
       + Added entry to set NumLock key OFF at startup.
       + The Map of keys was enlarged and optimized.
       * The installer now runs exclusively in 64-bit 
         (just like MediaKeys itself).
  1.0    First release.
